			<h4>Dr. Dinosaur D. Things</h4>
			<h3>Co-Founder, CEO</h3>
			<p>Dinosaur D. Things grew up on an isolated the western side of Kauai Island, Hawaii
				in the city of Walmea.  There on the tiny island he was always intrigued by the bigger
				world, what was out there, and what it had to offer. Dinosaur left Kauai for university
				and began his studies at Hazard University. It was there that Dinosaur realized how data and
				information can change the world. Dinosaur began his career in GIS soon after that and worked
				under many mentors until he started Jurassic Mapping five years ago.  He hopes to help others
				discover the stories the world has to offer through maps and GIS.</p>
