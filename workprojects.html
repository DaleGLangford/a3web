			<h3>Naperville Transportation Network</h3>
			<p>We were very excited to begin this project of creating a highly accurate representation of transportation for our clients at 
				Very Real Company Inc. in Naperville, Illinois. Here at Jurassic Mapping, we aren not above some digitizing work and as a matter of fact, several of us here
			  thoroughly enjoy spending countless hours staring closely at a monitor and making sure every line is exactly where it needs to be!</p>

			<h3>Database Design</h3>
			<p>Not all of our projects result in the creation of a map! For our clients at Fictional Tree Group Ltd., we are designing a database to store thousands of
				records on tree characteristics collected by amateur arborists. People accross the world will collect information such as tree species, tree height, 
				accuracy of the position, and health status. All of these characteristics will be stored in one place and will be easily accessible by our client.

			<h3>Mapping the Railway City</h3>
			<p>On a more artistic side, our clients at Totally Not Fake Co. from St. Thomas, Ontario, have tasked us with creating a state of the art map of their city! 
				St. Thomas is a fantastic place to visit for train aficionados, but certainly offers more than historic railways. At the top of the hill on the west end
				 of Talbot Rd lies a monument to Jumbo the Elephant, who was regarded as the largest circus elephant of the late 1800's. Jumbo met an unfortunate fate
				  after being fatally injured by a train, but his legacy lives on. To commemorate the birthday of Jumbo, this map which highlights what is theorized to be
				   Jumbo's favourite hang out spots will be published for the public to see in the local museum.
