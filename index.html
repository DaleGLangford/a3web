			<h3>Full Capacity</h3>
			<p>Dear current and potential new clients. During these difficult times, we are sad to announce that Jurassic Mapping will not be taking on any new clients
                or additional projects from existing clients for the next few months. Nothing makes us more happy than to have new and existing customers reach out
                to us with new projects to work on, however, there sometimes comes a point when you take on too many tasks that all of them collectively suffer. At Jurassic
                Mapping it is important to us that each and every project recieves the time it requires to achieve nothing less than the quality you have all come to expect
                from our company. Please be on the lookout for another newsletter update in the future indicatiing when we will be accepting new projects once again!</p>

                a step back and ask ourselves "what can we do better?" and "could we be doing more to meet our clients needs?". In pursuit of improving our companies
                ability to better serve you, we have sent out a short survey that asks questions regarding your satisifaction with the services we have provided.
