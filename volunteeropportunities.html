				<h3>Digitizing the Old Maps</h3>
				<p>Digitizing in GIS is the process of converting geographic data either
						from a hardcopy or a scanned image into vector data by tracing the 
						features. It leads to every feature having a proper locational identity.
						Here at Jurassic Mapping, you can come volunteer to help us in digitizing 
						the maps for our valuable clients. You can have the opportunity to work
						with our amazing dinosaur-obsessed team.</p>

				<h3>Data Collection</h3>
				<p>We have an ongoing project for our clients at Fictional Tree Group Ltd.
						which includes collecting the tree information such as tree species,
						accuracy of position, tree height and health status. So all the tree-huggers 
						out there, you can help us gather more information. We can use as much information
						as there is available for us to provide our clients with the best services.</p>

					<h3>Events and Conferences</h3>
					<p>We here at Jurassic Mapping love to host events and conferences. Anybody who wants can attend these events.
						You can volunteer to help us organize these events which includes several phases - Creating an organizing
						structure- putting together a group of people who are going to run the conference, and planning the ways
						they will work together. It gives you a chance to have a closer look at what goes on behind the scenes at our 
						company and also you get to meet people who have been working in the field for long.
						Hence, helping you to learn so many things and make contacts.

				<h3>Our New Coffee Machine</h3>
				<p>Our office has a new coffee machine, finally! Long working hours are not at all possible without coffee!
					Coffee is the constant need, it is the fuel to our brains. But! But we can't figure out this new machine, at all. So, anybody volunteering to help
					us figure out the machine, we love you already! </p>
