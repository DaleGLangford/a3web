				<h3>Digitizing the Old Maps</h3>
				<p>Digitizing in GIS is the process of converting geographic data either
						from a hardcopy or a scanned image into vector data by tracing the 
						features. It leads to every feature having a proper locational identity.
						Here at Jurassic Mapping, you can come volunteer to help us in digitizing 
						the maps for our valuable clients. You can have the opportunity to work
						with our amazing dinosaur-obsessed team.</p>
